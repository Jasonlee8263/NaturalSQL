It seems like there are two pieces of information here. The first number, 5, might represent a quantity or count, while the second number, 24.99, could be a price or value associated with that quantity. For example, if these were related to a product, it could mean you have 5 items, each priced at $24.99. Let me know if you need more details!

Asking: Who is the customer with the highest total order value, and what is that value?
Generated SQL Query: SELECT 
    Customers.Name,

FROM 
    Customers
JOIN 
    Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID
GROUP BY 
    Customers.CustomerID
ORDER BY 
    TotalOrderValue DESC
LIMIT 1;
